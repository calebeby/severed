CSS In JS Static Extractor!

[My previous work on this idea (archived)](https://github.com/calebeby/static-css-extract)

Idea: A css extractor for css in js: write css in js, extract it to .css files (like [Linaria](https://github.com/callstack/linaria), but not dependent on Babel, and much faster)
